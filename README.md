Simple responsive [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/) CSS theme.
It looks exactly like the default theme except it actually works on mobile.
It doesn't use any JavaScript and relies solely on CSS media queries.

# How to use:

Beyond switching original CSS file with the one in this repository you should also add `head-include` line in your `cgitrc` file.
For example:

```
head-include=/usr/share/webapps/cgit/head.html
```
